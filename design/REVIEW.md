## List of taken considerations for sketches/design

* 1 - Make it easy to read
* 2 - Make it easy to use
* 3 - Make it friendly for everyone

## Main problem we are solving for

* Create a website that predicts whether a Lego deal is profitable
* Prediction Accuraty / User Satisfaction / Data Quality

## Measures of the success

* Page load time < 2 seconds
* User satisfaction score > 4.5/5 in testing sessions
* Prediction accuracy > 85%

## List of visual aspects convictions

* Use of clear color codes (green for low risk...) to support intuitive understanding
* Minimalistic design with focus on essential data (price, risk, ID)
* Balanced whitespace to improve readability
* Use of rounded cards to create a friendly, modern look

## List of interaction patterns convictions

* Use of sorting and filtering for quick navigation
* Smooth scrolling or pagination to explore longer lists
* Hover tooltips for detailed explanations of metrics like P10, P70
